	This test assigns the exported fs module from ZenFS with the one exported from Node.
	This ensures anything new that is added will be caught

	Notes on omissions and exclusions:
	- __promisify__ is omitted as it is metadata
	- native is omitted as zenfs isn't native
	- ReadStream and WriteStream are excluded since they are polfilled from another module
*/
